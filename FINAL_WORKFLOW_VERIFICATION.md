## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. Database Structure (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `appointments.patient_id` and `appointments.specialist_id` were VARCHAR instead of BIGINT foreign keys

**Solution:** Created migration to convert to proper foreign keys with data migration

**Impact:** ✅ Data integrity enforced, relationships work correctly

### 2. Database View
**Problem:** `pending_appointments_view` didn't exist

**Solution:** Created proper view with correct table structure

**Impact:** ✅ Pending appointments visible in admin dashboard

### 3. Date/Time Formatting
**Problem:** Visit creation failed due to incorrect date/time concatenation

**Solution:** Proper formatting in AppointmentAutomationService and AppointmentCreationService

**Impact:** ✅ Visits created correctly with proper timestamps

### 4. Payment Status
**Problem:** Case sensitivity issue (Paid vs paid)

**Solution:** Standardized to lowercase throughout

**Impact:** ✅ Payment processing works correctly

### 5. Automation Completeness
**Problem:** AppointmentAutomationService wasn't creating billing links

**Solution:** Enhanced approveAppointment() method to create complete billing chain

**Impact:** ✅ Full automation from approval to billing
