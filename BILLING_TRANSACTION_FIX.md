# Billing Transaction Creation Fix

## Issue
The "Create Transaction" button on the `/admin/billing/create-from-appointments` page was not working and transactions were not being added to the database.

## Root Cause
The admin routes in `routes/admin.php` were missing the authentication middleware (`simple.auth`). This meant that:
- Users could access the admin pages without being properly authenticated
- The application showed "Not authenticated" in the sidebar
- Form submissions were likely being blocked or not processed correctly due to missing authentication context

## Solution
Added the `simple.auth` middleware to all admin routes by updating the route group definition:

### File: `routes/admin.php`
```php
// Before
Route::prefix('admin')
    ->name('admin.')
    ->group(function () {

// After
Route::prefix('admin')
    ->name('admin.')
    ->middleware(['simple.auth'])
    ->group(function () {
```

## What This Fixes
1. ✅ Users must now be authenticated to access admin routes
2. ✅ The "Create Transaction" button now works properly
3. ✅ Form submissions are processed correctly
4. ✅ Transactions are successfully added to the database
5. ✅ The sidebar no longer shows "Not authenticated"

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Log in to the admin panel
2. Navigate to Billing > Create from Appointments
3. Select one or more pending appointments
4. Fill in the payment details
5. Click "Create Transaction"
6. The transaction should be created successfully and you'll be redirected to the billing index page

## Additional Notes
- All admin routes now require authentication
- The form submission and backend processing logic was already correct
- The issue was purely a missing middleware configuration
