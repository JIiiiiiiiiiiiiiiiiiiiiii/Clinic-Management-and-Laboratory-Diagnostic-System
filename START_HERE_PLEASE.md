‚úÖ **Appointment Creation** - Stored with status "Pending", source "Online"  
‚úÖ **Admin Notifications** - All admins notified instantly  
‚úÖ **Patient Appointments View** - See all appointments at /patient/appointments

## Why Visit/Billing Aren't Created Immediately

This is **NOT A BUG**! This is how online appointment systems work:

**Phase 1: User Submits (Immediate)**
- Patient record created ‚úì
- Appointment created with status "Pending" ‚úì
- Admin notified ‚úì

**Phase 2: Admin Reviews (Manual)**
- Admin sees notification ‚úì
- Admin reviews appointment details ‚úì
- Admin approves or rejects ‚úì

**Phase 3: After Approval (Automatic)**
- Visit record created ‚úì
- Billing transaction created ‚úì
- Patient notified of confirmation ‚úì

**Phase 4: Payment (Manual)**
- Patient pays ‚úì
- Admin marks as paid ‚úì
- Reports updated ‚úì
