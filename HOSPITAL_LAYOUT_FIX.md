# 🏥 Hospital Interface Layout Fix Complete

## **Problem Identified**
The hospital interface pages were missing the proper layout structure, causing the sidebar navigation to disappear when navigating between pages.

## **Root Cause**
The hospital pages I created were not wrapped in the `AppLayout` component, which is responsible for:
- Rendering the sidebar navigation
- Providing consistent layout structure
- Managing breadcrumbs
- Handling responsive design

## **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Proper Layout Structure**
All hospital pages now use the `AppLayout` component with proper breadcrumbs:

```tsx
import AppLayout from '@/layouts/app-layout';
import { type BreadcrumbItem } from '@/types';

// In each component:
const breadcrumbs: BreadcrumbItem[] = [
  { label: 'Hospital Dashboard', href: route('hospital.dashboard') },
  { label: 'Current Page', href: route('current.route') },
];

return (
  <AppLayout breadcrumbs={breadcrumbs}>
    {/* Page content */}
  </AppLayout>
);
```

### **2. Files Fixed**

#### **Report Pages**
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Index.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Patients.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Appointments.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Transactions.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Inventory.tsx`

#### **Patient Management Pages**
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Index.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Create.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Refer.tsx`

### **3. Layout Structure Now Consistent**

All hospital pages now have:
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Hospital sidebar with proper menu structure
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear navigation path
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches admin interface design

### **4. Navigation Structure**

The hospital interface now has proper navigation with:

```
Hospital Dashboard
├── Patients
│   ├── View Patients
│   ├── Add Patient
│   └── Refer Patient
└── View Reports
    ├── All Patient Reports
    ├── All Appointment Reports
    ├── All Transaction Reports

- ✅ **Consistent Sidebar**: Navigation remains visible on all pages
