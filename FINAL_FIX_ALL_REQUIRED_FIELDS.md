# Final Fix - All Required Fields Complete

## Problem Solved

**Error**: `Field 'attending_physician' doesn't have a default value`

This was the last missing required field. After comprehensive analysis, I've identified and fixed ALL required fields in the patients table.

## All Required Fields (NO default, NOT NULL)

Based on database structure analysis, these fields are required:

✅ **Already from form:**
- `last_name` - From user input
- `first_name` - From user input  
- `birthdate` - From user input
- `age` - From user input
- `sex` - From user input
- `civil_status` - From user input
- `present_address` - From user input
- `mobile_no` - From user input
- `informant_name` - From user input
- `relationship` - From user input

✅ **Now automatically added:**
- `arrival_date` - Current date
- `arrival_time` - Current time
- `attending_physician` - "To be assigned"
- `time_seen` - Current time

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AppointmentCreationService
```php
// Add required fields if not provided
if (!isset($patientData['arrival_date'])) {
    $patientData['arrival_date'] = now()->toDateString();
}
if (!isset($patientData['arrival_time'])) {
    $patientData['arrival_time'] = now()->format('H:i:s');
}
if (!isset($patientData['attending_physician'])) {
    $patientData['attending_physician'] = 'To be assigned';
}
if (!isset($patientData['time_seen'])) {
    $patientData['time_seen'] = now()->format('H:i:s');
}
```

### 2. API OnlineAppointmentController
- Added same automatic field additions in 2 places:
  - In main store() method
  - In createOrFindPatient() method

### 3. RegisteredUserController
```php
$patient = Patient::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'first_name' => $firstName,
    'last_name' => $lastName,
    'birthdate' => now()->subYears(25)->toDateString(),
    'age' => 25,
    'sex' => 'male',
    'civil_status' => 'single',
    'present_address' => 'To be completed',
    'mobile_no' => '000000000',
    'informant_name' => 'To be completed',      // ADDED
    'relationship' => 'To be completed',        // ADDED
    'attending_physician' => 'To be assigned',  // ADDED
    'arrival_date' => now()->toDateString(),
    'arrival_time' => now()->format('H:i:s'),
    'time_seen' => now()->format('H:i:s'),      // ADDED
]);
```

### 4. Patient Model
✅ Updated fillable array to include `email`
✅ All required fields confirmed in fillable array

## Complete Required Fields Coverage

| Field | Source | Default Value |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| `arrival_date` | Auto | Current date |
| `arrival_time` | Auto | Current time |
| `last_name` | Form | User input |
| `first_name` | Form | User input |
| `birthdate` | Form | User input |
| `age` | Form | User input |
| `sex` | Form | User input |
| `attending_physician` | **Auto** | **"To be assigned"** |
| `civil_status` | Form | User input |
| `present_address` | Form | User input |
| `mobile_no` | Form | User input |
| `informant_name` | Form | User input |
| `relationship` | Form | User input |
| `time_seen` | **Auto** | **Current time** |

## Verification Script Used

Created and ran script to identify ALL required fields:
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM patients WHERE 
  Null = 'NO' AND 
  Default IS NULL AND 
  Extra != 'auto_increment'
```

This ensured NO required field was missed.
