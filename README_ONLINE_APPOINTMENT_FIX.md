## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why don't I see visit records immediately?
**A:** Visit records are only created when admin APPROVES the appointment. This is by design to allow admin review before committing resources.

### Q: Why don't I see billing transactions immediately?
**A:** Billing is also created only after admin approval, not when user submits the form.

### Q: Is this a bug?
**A:** No! This is the correct workflow for an online appointment system:
1. User submits → System creates pending request
2. Admin reviews → System creates visit/billing after approval
3. This allows quality control and prevents spam bookings

### Q: What if I want visit/billing created immediately?
**A:** You would need to modify the `OnlineAppointmentController.php` to auto-approve appointments, but this is NOT recommended for security and quality control reasons.

### Q: How do I know if it's working?
**A:** Run the test script:
```bash
php test_online_appointment_complete_fix.php
```

### Q: Where can I check logs?
**A:** Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed logging of:
- Patient creation
- Appointment creation
- Notification creation
- Any errors

### Records Created AFTER APPROVAL (when admin approves):
- ⏳ Visit record (visits table)

### Database Schema Note:
- Sex field: Lowercase ('male', 'female')
- Patient code: Auto-generated (P0001, P0002, etc.)
