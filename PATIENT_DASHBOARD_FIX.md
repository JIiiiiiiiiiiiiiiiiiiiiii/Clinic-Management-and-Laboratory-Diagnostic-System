# 🔧 Patient Dashboard Fix - Issue Resolved!

## **✅ FIXED: Patient Dashboard Error**

The error was caused by the `PatientDashboardController` trying to call `$user->appointments()` method that didn't exist in the User model.

## **🔍 What Was the Problem?**

### **Error Details:**
```
BadMethodCallException
Call to undefined method App\Models\User::appointments()
```

### **Root Cause:**
- The `User` model and `Patient` model are separate entities

- **Features**: Welcome message, stats cards, quick actions, appointment management
