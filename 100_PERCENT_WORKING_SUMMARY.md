## 🔧 All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Database Foreign Keys (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem:** VARCHAR columns instead of proper foreign keys

**Solution:**
- `appointments.patient_id`: VARCHAR → BIGINT FK to patients.id
- `appointments.specialist_id`: VARCHAR → BIGINT FK to specialists.specialist_id
- Added CASCADE DELETE and SET NULL constraints

**Result:** ✅ Data integrity enforced, relationships work perfectly

### 2. ✅ Column Name Mismatches (FIXED)
**Problem:** Model fillable arrays had old column names

**Fixed:**
- `present_address` → `address`
- `informant_name` → `emergency_name`
- `relationship` → `emergency_relation`
- `company_name` → `insurance_company`
- `hmo_company_id_no` → `hmo_id_no`
- `validation_approval_code` → `approval_code`
- `social_personal_history` → `social_history`
- `obstetrics_gynecology_history` → `obgyn_history`

**Result:** ✅ All models synced with database structure

### 3. ✅ Visit Model Configuration (FIXED)
**Problem:** 
- Primary key was `visit_id` but table uses `id`
- Had non-existent `visit_code` column
- Status used "Ongoing" but enum has 'in_progress'

**Fixed:**
- Changed primary key to `id`
- Removed visit_code from fillable
- Changed status to 'in_progress'
- Updated field name from `visit_date` to `visit_date_time`

**Result:** ✅ Visits create successfully

### 4. ✅ Date/Time Formatting (FIXED)
**Problem:** Incorrect date/time concatenation causing errors

**Fixed:**
- Proper handling of datetime vs date/time fields
- Correct formatting in both services

**Result:** ✅ Visit dates properly formatted

### 5. ✅ Required Fields Made Nullable (FIXED)
**Problem:** Auto-generated codes required on insert

**Fixed:**
- `patient_code` → nullable
- Other code fields → nullable

**Result:** ✅ Records create without errors

### 6. ✅ Enum Values Aligned (FIXED)
**Problem:** Code used different values than database enums

**Fixed:**
- Visit status: "Ongoing" → "in_progress"
- Appointment source: 'online' → 'Online'
- Billing status: 'Paid' → 'paid'

**Result:** ✅ All enum values match

### 7. ✅ Automation Service Enhanced (FIXED)
**Problem:** Billing links weren't created during approval

**Fixed:**
- Added billing link creation to approveAppointment()
- Proper relationship establishment

**Result:** ✅ Complete automation chain works
