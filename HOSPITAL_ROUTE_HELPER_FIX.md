# ✅ Hospital Pages Route Helper Fix

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `An error occurred in the <HospitalPatientsIndex> component`
**Cause**: The `route` helper function was not imported, causing React to throw an error when trying to use `route('hospital.dashboard')` etc.

## Root Cause
The hospital pages were using the `route()` helper function but not importing it from `ziggy-js`. This caused a JavaScript error that prevented the pages from rendering, resulting in white pages.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing import to all hospital pages:

```typescript
import { route } from 'ziggy-js';
```

## Files Fixed
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Dashboard.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Index.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Create.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Refer.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Index.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Patients.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Appointments.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Transactions.tsx`
✅ `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Inventory.tsx`

## What Was Changed
Each hospital page now has the proper import:

**Before:**
```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Head, Link, router } from '@inertiajs/react';
// Missing: import { route } from 'ziggy-js';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Head, Link, router } from '@inertiajs/react';
import { route } from 'ziggy-js'; // ✅ Added this import
```

## How to Test
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Navigate to hospital pages**:
   - `/hospital/dashboard`
   - `/hospital/patients`
   - `/hospital/patients/create`
   - `/hospital/patients/refer`
   - `/hospital/reports`
   - `/hospital/reports/patients`
   - `/hospital/reports/appointments`
   - `/hospital/reports/transactions`
   - `/hospital/reports/inventory`

## Expected Results
✅ **No more white pages**
✅ **No more React errors in console**
✅ **All hospital pages load correctly**
✅ **Sidebar navigation works**
✅ **Sub-tabs are clickable and functional**

## Technical Details
- The `route` helper is used for generating URLs in breadcrumbs and navigation
- It's provided by the Ziggy package which is configured in Laravel
- The helper needs to be explicitly imported in each component that uses it
- This is a common issue when using Ziggy with TypeScript/React

## Status: FIXED ✅

All hospital pages should now load correctly without React errors. The sub-tabs should be fully functional and the sidebar should persist across all pages.

**Next Steps**: Test each hospital page to confirm they're working properly.
