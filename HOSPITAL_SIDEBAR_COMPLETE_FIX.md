# ✅ Hospital Interface - Complete Sidebar Fix

## Problem Solved
The hospital interface sidebar was disappearing when navigating between pages. This has been completely fixed.

## What Was Fixed

### All Hospital Pages Now Have Proper Layout

1. **Hospital Dashboard** (`/hospital/dashboard`)
   - ✅ Added breadcrumbs
   - ✅ Wrapped with AppLayout

2. **Patient Management Pages**
   - ✅ View Patients (`/hospital/patients`)
   - ✅ Add Patient (`/hospital/patients/create`)
   - ✅ Refer Patient (`/hospital/patients/refer`)

3. **Report Pages**
   - ✅ Reports Dashboard (`/hospital/reports`)
   - ✅ Patient Reports (`/hospital/reports/patients`)
   - ✅ Appointment Reports (`/hospital/reports/appointments`)
   - ✅ Transaction Reports (`/hospital/reports/transactions`)
   - ✅ Inventory Reports (`/hospital/reports/inventory`)

## Files Modified

### React Components
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Dashboard.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Index.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Create.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Patients/Refer.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Index.tsx`

- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Appointments.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Transactions.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/Hospital/Reports/Inventory.tsx`

### Key Changes Made
Each page now includes:
```typescript
import AppLayout from '@/layouts/app-layout';
import { type BreadcrumbItem } from '@/types';

const breadcrumbs: BreadcrumbItem[] = [
  { label: 'Hospital Dashboard', href: route('hospital.dashboard') },
  { label: 'Current Page', href: route('current.route') },
];

return (
  <AppLayout breadcrumbs={breadcrumbs}>
    {/* Page content */}
  </AppLayout>
);
```
